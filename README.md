# MP1-OnePieceMatchingGame
Milestone Project 1 for SD Bootcamp. My first Web Browser Game!!

        ONE PIECE MATCHING GAME
Inspired by one of my FAVORITE Animes, 'One Piece', a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Eiichiro Oda.


HOW TO PLAY (Instructions):
    As simple as choosing a card and trying to find the matching character image pair.
    Your playing against a CPU so try to get more matches than it before you run out of cards
    ... Thats it! Have fun!!!
